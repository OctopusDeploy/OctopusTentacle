# How to Raise a Meaningful Change

To have your changes reflected on the Downloads Page, you will need to submit what is known as a "Meaningful Change."

Without a meaningful change, the updates won't appear as a new version of Tentacle on the Downloads page, even if they've been merged into the main branch.

To submit a meaningful change, please follow these steps:

1. If an issue does not already exist, create one to describe the problem your change addresses.
2. Create a pull request that includes your changes. In the Results section, please include a keyword such as "Resolves #999" along with your issue number. Here are the [appropriate keywords to close issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword).
3. Merge the PR once it passes all necessary checks.
4. By doing this, you will ensure that your changes are recognized as a new version of Tentacle, available on the Downloads page.
